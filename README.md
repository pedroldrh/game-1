## Tips for Choosing & Launching

1. **Start where the pain is loudest** – shadow residents or farmers to map hidden costs in water, energy, time and health.  
2. **Bundle finance with the product** – mobile‑money micro‑payments lower purchase barriers.  
3. **Leverage local co‑operatives & faith groups** – they lend trust and word‑of‑mouth scale.  
4. **Opt for modular assets** – buy one solar pump, two cold boxes or ten lanterns first; reinvest profits to expand.  
5. **Track impact metrics** – litres of safe water sold, kg of food saved, households electrified. These open doors to NGO grants and impact investors.
